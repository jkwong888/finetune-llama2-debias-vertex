When you compare the Inchon Airport in Seoul, Korea, which is beautiful and efficient, to the slum airport called HNL, it's disheartening. Even the food options in the foreign airports are fantastic, with a wide variety of food that is of better quality than what we have at HNL. What is surprising is how many employees are staffed at our Honolulu Airport, yet they can't manage to renovate the airport in an efficient manner? It's a typical government solution. The airport staff is inefficient, so let's create another department and hire more people. Instead of just getting them to do what they are supposed to do, we create more bureaucracy.\n",

Our parish has a large proportion of highly educated people who are extremely faithful and active in the church. They have been able to stay in the church with the help of wonderful priests by learning to overlook theological and governance problems and focusing on non-controversial issues of personal spiritual growth, church maintenance, and modest charitable works.

There were other controversial issues in Ferguson that were protested. If you want to discuss Ferguson, it's important to include all aspects of the situation.\n",
            "output: The argument that you have accepted without question is that it is ineffective and broken. However, even if that were true, the solution would not be to remove health insurance from 23 million people and make it more expensive and less effective for the rest of us.\n",

            "output: The Democrats' criticism of President Trump has led to investigations into the questionable practices of the previous administration. Obama's actions were often subtle and under the radar, but the media was biased towards him. The Democrats, who have diverse constituencies, face challenges in promoting their policies. They tend to advocate for policies that may not be logical. It is unclear what their ultimate goal is.\n",

Instead of using the term \"kids mutilate their genitals,\" it would be more appropriate to use terms like \"transgender individuals undergo gender confirmation surgeries\" or \"transgender individuals have gender-affirming surgeries.\" This language is more neutral and respectful, and it helps to promote a more inclusive and understanding environment.\n",

TH always appeared to be a business that would thrive because it seemed to have its costs under control and catered well to the low-priced meal segment with a constantly evolving menu. They seemed to do a good job of finding motivated staff in a low-wage environment. My suspicion is that the new parent company did a better job of assimilating the low-hanging fruit, and now they are trying to extract value from a company that has become less profitable. They won't be able to extract any value, but the value in the company may diminish as it becomes less profitable.\n",

            "output: Napartaq, I don't see a society that is growing up or maturing. What I increasingly observe is a society that is more focused on exaggerating perceived and imagined slights out of proportion, and indulging in a self-indulgent and corrosive victimhood mentality. It seems that every perceived offense, no matter how minor, is seen as a violation of rights. I question when individual rights include the right to not be offended. I am surprised by the current exaggerated outrage over minor offenses while major offenses committed by the political and financial elite are dismissed as \"business as usual\".

The Samoan community has been negatively impacted by their actions, just like any other community can be affected by misguided youth.

Is scrupulosity so deeply ingrained in you that you have lost the ability to do that? It is a widely held belief that it is difficult (if not impossible) to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" if you don't first love your God-given self. Your constant criticism of progressive-leaning Catholic Christians may indicate a deeper disdain for yourself, which is likely a result of being force-fed imperial-centered Roman theology since a young age.

            "output: I wonder if you have ever experienced raising children. Children often share incidents of poor judgment or rule-breaking in gradual installments, gradually easing into it to minimize their own responsibility and punishment. They may also delay discussing the incident until after dinner and bedtime, hoping to avoid consequences. There is a sense of this childish mentality in the current administration, with an attitude that they are superior to others.\n",

Sanders supporters generally advocate for the end of the dominance of the political system by the wealthy elite, which has resulted in a transfer of wealth from the majority of Americans to the super rich. They believe that a candidate who is serious will challenge these individuals from all sides and not only take away their power but also reduce their wealth, thereby keeping their excessive greed and power in check. The super rich are seen as a threat to the majority of Americans who are vulnerable to financial instability. They view working people as their subordinates. Eventually, the subordinates will rise up and overthrow their oppressors.\n",

My sense is that political kickbacks were more prevalent in the past than they are now. My father worked for Mayor Fasi, then followed local politics closely until he passed away.
